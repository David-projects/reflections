What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

it creates a git repository, becouse there was no repository there before.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the
repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area just holds files before you commit, where the working
directory is where the work is done.

The staging directory lets you group files before commiting.
