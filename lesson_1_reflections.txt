How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    made it faster to find the bug

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

   easy to rollback code and see diferent versions

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    You can commit when you are ready and you do not have as many commit
points

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

	it depends on the files and what you are doing, you need to use the
right tool for what you are doing. it is easier and faster to commit many
files for codes but for someone that is writing a book this may not be needed.


How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    diff -u old file new file 
helps fine file differents from the last commit to the lastest commit.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    easier to roll back code and find where the code broke

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    work
